Darko DRAZOVIC (HTML+CSS online CV)
=========
An HTML document meant to be some form of my online CV is my first HTML+CSS (template) that I created from zero to satisfy minimalism which I didn't find in other HTML templates, and of course, to try to learn HTML basics.\
It has a **100/100 score** on https://pagespeed.web.dev
